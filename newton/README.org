* Method Newton Rampson
The Newton-Raphson method (also known as Newton's method) is a way to quickly find a good approximation for the root of a real-valued function f(x)=0f(x) = 0f(x)=0. It uses the idea that a continuous and differentiable function can be approximated by a straight line tangent to it.
** Limitation
Newton's method may not work if there are points of inflection, local maxima or minima around x0x_0x0â€‹ or the root.

* COMPOSITE TRAPEZOIDAL RULE
Is a technique for approximating the definite integral. 
The approximation becomes more accurate as the resolution of the partition increases.
Divide the incline line into n smaller segments, we will have lots of trapezoidal. The sum over the area of all trapezoidal and get the total area under the curve which is the integral.
The error is significantly reduced comparisons 

** Trapezoidal Rule
The trapezoidal rule works by approximating the region under the graph of the function f(x) as a trapezoid and calculating its area. 
With this metod we overestimating and underestimating only areas beetween the curve and incline line.
Give us better result in comparisons of rectagunlar method.
